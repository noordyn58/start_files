        father like no other, firstly I think I need to give it to moriam for this great reminder seeing this now I was wow!
        
        my dad has been so phenomenon in dealing with all his children right from the firstborn to the last if you must know he is baba olomo Pupo (Father that gave birth to so many children Lol!) God bless him. Still, no child has ever been denied of his presence when needed as always he makes sure that every single child is educated is now left to you how far you want to go because he will always be there despite the absolute limited financial capability. 
        
        I will ever appreciate my dad for how he brought us up and gave us that life, hope, and strength. He deserves more but Alhamdulillah is still very much alive I pray dad, you are such a great father. On this day, as we celebrate you, I seize the opportunity to say thank you to Allah the almighty for blessing me with you. May God's grace continue to guide you in light and health May he turn his ears towards you and grant all your heartâ€™s desires. Happy Birthday, Dad.
        You know what dad, the only thing better than having you as my dad is my children having you as a GRANPA
